# shelterpet
A fundraising site for disabled pets

In recent years people have begun to value their pets more as family, subsequently veterinary science has advanced to provide options for serious ailments that were previously unavailable for pets but these treatments come at a cost. Many times when families or breeders are unable to afford the cost of an expensive lifesaving treatment or operation, they will turn the pet over to a shelter or rescue in hopes the rescue can raise the money to give the animal a chance at life it would not have had in the past.

This has left shelters and rescues in a unique position where they are fundraising more then ever, not just for their day to day needs, but for individual special needs and disabled pets. The organizations often launch huge social media campaigns with varying results. The successful campaign relies on them to be able to create a narrative, post updates, let people know exactly what is needed (and update that if/when it changes), answer questions, and have their campaign shared and donated to.

At the moment these campaigns are hosted all over the place, facebook fundraising, GoFundMe, youcaring, and the issue with these is they do not allow a single place to host multiple fundraisers, create a timeline with updates for all of them on their profile, update old fundraisers with success stories, and keep their audience engaged.

Our app seeks to utilize AWS to create a crowdsourcing app where shelters and rescues can create pages, manage multiple campaigns, creative a narrative, quickly and easily engage their audience, collect donations, and have their campaign shared to multiple sites.
